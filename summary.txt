IMDb Scraper

Description:

This project serves to provide various functions on movies, using
the actors of the movies to make connections. For example, we can find
the actors with the farthest distance from each other, or we can find the
farthest movies from actors. The limitations of the Bacon Number only taking
in actors as inputs are not here, as movies and actors can be used in
either order when finding the farthest or any arbitrary distances between
two movies, actors, or one of each. Additionally, our recommendation algorithms
use both triadic closure and neighborhood overlap to recommend the top 10 
movies to a user based on either a list of up to 3 input movies or an input
of the user's favorite actor. These two recommendation algorithms use the 
features of the neighborhood in the Graph to provide movies which would likely
be similar to the user's taste and recommend them. 

The program runs in a basic user shell, where the user can type 'help' to see 
the commands accepted by the program. After seeing them, the user can simply
type a number 1-9 to access the prompt for a command. At this point, the user
can provide their input and the graph based on the IMDb database will have
the algorithms performed on it to return the output to the user. The dataset
was cleaned in a Jupyter notebook, which is provided in the code. Originally,
we had wanted to webscrape the IMDb website ourselves and output the data, 
but unfortunately IMDb does not allow webscraping, but using their data from 
datasets for personal, non-commercial projects is allowed, so we do not
violate their Terms of Service this way.
